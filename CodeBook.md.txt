Getting and Cleaning Data Project Code Book
==================================================================

Description:
============
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

Source Data:
============
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Data Info:
==========
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

Data Analysis:
==============

Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
==

Read Data:
---------
- ActivityLabel:	read data "activity_labels.txt"
- Features:	read data "features.txt"
- TrainingSet:	read data "X_train.txt"
- TrainingLabel:	read data "y_train.txt"
- TrainingSub:	read data "subject_train.txt"
- TestSet:		read data "X_test.txt"
- TestLabel:	read data "y_test.txt"
- Subject:		read data "subject_test.txt"

Merge Data:
-----------
- AllData:	merge data set of TrainingSet and TestSet
- Label:	merge data set of TrainingLabel and TestLabel
- Subject:	merge data set of TrainingSub and TestSub

Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
==

- selectCol:	logic vector where features contains "-mean" or "-std" is TRUE
- selectedData:	Data set only contains measruements on mean or standard deviation
- selectedName:	vector of features that only contains mean or srandard deviation

Step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
==

- Activity:	create a list of corresponding activity description of Label
- DataSet:		Final dataset combining selected mesurements, label, activity description and subject

Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
==

- DataName:	vector of selectedName and names of label, activity description and subject.
- use colnames() to add name of each column

Step 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
==

- tidyData:	use aggregate() to create new data frame of selected measurements in data set grouped by Activity and Subject

- add column names to tidyData
- write tidyData to file called "tidy_data.txt"
